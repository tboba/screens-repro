# react-native-screens | My repros

Hi there! I'm using this repository to put the repros of the issues I've submitted on react-native-screens [repository](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-screens).

## Using the repros
Simply go to the desired branch and download the code from the selected one.
After that, install packages from npm/yarn, run `npm/yarn start` and you should be ready to go ðŸŽ‰
